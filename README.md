# ClickyGame

This is a memory build application using React and also the useState and useEffect Hooks. When a card is displayed on the screen, face down, the user clicks on the card to reveal or flip the card. Only two of the cards can be picked at one time. If the card matches then you  continue with the game until all matches are selected. The game will end when all cards are selected or the user runs out of time. Cards will shuffle as well.
